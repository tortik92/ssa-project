# Libraries

This directory contains project-specific (private) libraries for the SoundLeap SSA project. These libraries are compiled into static libraries and linked into the executable file by PlatformIO.

## Libraries Overview

### `/lib/comm`
This library handles communication-related functionality, including:
- **`BLEComm`**: Bluetooth Low Energy communication.
- **`PadsComm`**: Communication with external pads.

### `/lib/interpreter`
This library implements the core interpreter logic, including:
- **`Environment`**: Manages the runtime environment.
- **`Interpreter`**: Executes parsed code.
- **`NativeFunctions`**: Provides built-in functions for the interpreter.
- **`Values`**: Defines data structures for interpreter values.

### `/lib/lexer`
This library is responsible for lexical analysis, converting source code into tokens:
- **`Lexer`**: Tokenizes the input source code.

### `/lib/parser`
This library handles parsing, converting tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST):
- **`AstNodes`**: Defines the structure of AST nodes.
- **`Parser`**: Parses tokens into an AST.
