# Test Directory

This directory contains unit tests for the SoundLeap SSA project. The tests are designed to validate the functionality of individual components and ensure the reliability of the system.

## Overview

The tests are implemented using the PlatformIO Unit Testing framework and cover various modules of the project, including the lexer, parser, interpreter, and runtime environment.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the PlatformIO Test Runner. Execute the following command in the root of the project:

```sh
pio test
```

This will compile and execute all the tests defined in this directory.

## Test Coverage

### Lexer Tests

- Tokenization of single tokens, numbers, keywords, operators, and identifiers.

### Parser Tests

- Variable declarations (constants, numbers, strings, objects, arrays).
- Expression parsing (assignment, additive, multiplicative).
- Control structures (if, if-else, while, break).
- Function calls and member expressions.

### Values Tests

- Constructors for null, boolean, number, string, and object types.
- Copy and move semantics for strings and objects.
- Object insertion and cloning.

### Environment Tests

- Global environment setup.
- Variable declaration, assignment, lookup, and resolution.
- Native function integration (e.g., random number generation).

### Native Functions Tests

- Built-in functions like print and rnd.

### Interpreter Tests

- Execution of variable declarations, expressions, control structures, and function calls.
- Handling of object and array member expressions.
